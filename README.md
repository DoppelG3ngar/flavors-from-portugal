## About

Welcome to the Flavors from Portugal, a culinary journey through the culture of Portugal. This website is a curated collection of my favorite Portuguese dishes, each carefully selected to highlight the rich and diverse heritage of Portugal. From savory seafood to delectable desserts, every recipe brings a taste of Portugal to your kitchen.

But this website is more than just a recipe collection; it is also a demonstration of my skills in web development and DevOps. The Portuguese recipe gallary is built with a modern tech stack, featuring a responsive and user-friendly frontend and seamless integration and deployment pipelines.
